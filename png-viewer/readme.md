## Concept

Display any of the 16,384 Jaanga Terrain 3 Second PNG files quickly and easily

- Loads 3 second data (accurate to 90 meters) quickly
- Shows data for any location on the globe;
- Supports permalink hash tags for position
- Displays longitude and latitude and other useful data
- Very simple JavaScript code
