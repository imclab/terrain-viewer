## Issues

2014-01-28  
The current big issue is that - often but not always - nothing happens wnen you change the zoom, scale, overlay, latitude or longitude

Workaround: Change city location - just about always causes an update

If you go to some hight altitude location such as Mount Everest or Machu Pichu - and see nothing - the map may be above you and you will need to drag it into view.

Vertical scale is is set quite high by default. This is to help provide a game-like experience. Feel free to change the scale.


## To Be Done
